# Spotify-vs.-Apple-Music-Twitter-Analysis

## Project Overview
A project exploring different artists' popularity on Spotify and Apple Music. Project includes homegrown "top 10 artists" based on exposure through Twitter.

## Task
This project is an analysis of the top 10 Spotify and Apple Music artists (top charts from each platform recorded on 4/24/20). Tweets containing each artist's name were scraped and cleansed. The main focus of this project is to create a unique top 10 based just on the scraped tweets and observe the differences between this list, Spotify's list, and Apple Music's list. With the tweets, we created a "tweet rating" metric. The metric is meant to determine how "valuable" a tweet is in predicting the position of an artist in the top 10.
